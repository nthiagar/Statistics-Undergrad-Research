### 1. BMI vs Heart Disease (Tableau)
- **File:** `BMI vs Heart Disease.twbx`
- **Description:** This Tableau workbook includes:
  - Sorting the data into BMI buckets.

- **File:** `BMI_HDA_BP.ipynb`
- **Description:** This Python file includes:
  - Sorting the data into BMI buckets.
  - Calculating the odds of low and high blood pressure.
  - Creating a 3D plot to visualize the relationship between heart disease, BMI, and blood pressure.

## How to Use
To explore the analyses and visualizations:
